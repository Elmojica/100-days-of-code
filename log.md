# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 7, 2022 (Example 1)

**Today's Progress**: Started "The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp" course on Udemy

**Thoughts:** 

I spent the majority of my time reading some material, including the recommended "12 Rules to learn how to code", later I got recommended to jump straight into the javascript section of the course, I will most likely revisit the HTML and CSS sections

### Day 0: February 30, 2016 (Example 2)
##### (delete me or comment me out)

**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

### Day 1: June 27, Monday

**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
